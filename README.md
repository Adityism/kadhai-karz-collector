# Kadhai Karz Collector üç≥üí∏

## What is this?

This is the world's most persistent, slightly passive-aggressive, and definitely automated daily reminder system for collecting that one kadhai (wok) contribution your friend Bhavi keeps forgetting to pay. 

Every day, this codebase will send a new, witty, and occasionally existential email to Bhavi, reminding him to cough up his ‚Çπ216 for the legendary kadhai. The reminders are so creative, even Gordon Ramsay would be proud (or at least mildly amused).

## Why does this exist?

Because friendship is built on trust, laughter, and the relentless pursuit of unpaid cookware debts. Also, because Bhavi still hasn't paid.

## How does it work?

- Stores a list of hilarious reminder messages.
- Rotates through them daily, so Bhavi never gets bored (or comfortable).
- Sends an email using your SMTP credentials (set in `.env`).
- Logs everything, so you can prove you tried your best.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your SMTP details.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run it:
   ```bash
   python3 reminder.py
   ```

## Environment Variables

- `SMTP_HOST` - Your SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
- `SMTP_PORT` - SMTP port (e.g., 587)
- `SMTP_USER` - Your email address
- `SMTP_PASS` - Your email password or app password
- `FROM_EMAIL` - (Optional) Sender email (defaults to SMTP_USER)
- `TO_EMAIL` - (Optional) Recipient email (defaults to SMTP_USER)

## Can I use this for other debts?

Absolutely! Just change the messages and recipient. But remember: with great power comes great responsibility (and possibly annoyed friends).
